# Step-by-step: Connect SAP with SharePoint
Read this chapter to learn how to connect Microsoft SharePoint Online via **`aqilink`** as SAP Content Repository. 
Ensure you are familiar with the configurations for [SAP Content Repository Connection](/installation/#sap-http-content-server-connection) and [Storage Connection](/configuration/aqishare/#storage-connections) beforehand, as these are prerequisites. Also, make sure you have completed the [application registration in Microsoft Azure AD](/configuration/storages/sharepoint/azure).

### HTTPS preferred connection
For the connection between SAP and SharePoint, we recommend preferring HTTPS over HTTP. 
HTTPS ensures that data is encrypted during transit, thereby preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data integrity. Prior to proceeding with this chapter, please ensure that an HTTPS connection is established. Refer to our chapter [Communication via HTTPS](/reference/aqilink_sap_https) in the reference section for guidance on setup.


## Create SAP Content Repository
Follow these steps to create a new SAP Content Repository connected to **`aqilink`**.

!> Use a SAP dialog user with Administration permission.

1) Login to SAP and execute the following transaction: `OAC0`. It will display a list of all available SAP Content Repositories in the SAP system.
2) To create a new SAP Content Repository switch to *Edit* mode (`CTRL`+`F4` ), then press `F5`.  
3) Now, create a new entry using the following values:

   | Property      | Description | Example |
   | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
   | **Content Rep.** | Unique name for the repository in SAP.  |  `O1`, `O2` |
   | **Description** | A description to identify the repository easily. Visible only to SAP admin in the SAP Content Repository overview.  |  `SharePoint Online Content Repository` |
   | **Document Area** | Select `ArchiveLink` from the dropdown list to use ArchiveLink and Attachment functionality. Select `Document Management System` to use SAP DMS (Document Info Records).  |  `ArchiveLink`, `DMS` |
   | **Storage Type** | Always select `HTTP content server` from the list. |  `HTTP content server` |
   | **Version no.** | Specify the SAP Content Server version. Supported are `0045`, `0046` and `0047` (recommended for all SAP S/4HANA systems) . |  `0047` |
   | **HTTP server** | Specify the server, IP address or hostname, where **`aqilink`** is running. |  `11.2.0.112` |
   | **SSL Port Number** | Specify the port on the **`aqilink`** server above where the app is running. Default: `3000`. If necessary change the port mapping based on the used orchestration tool. |  `3000` |
   | **HTTP Script** | The main entry point of the **`aqilink`** app. It always starts with the prefix **`sapHttp`** followed by an existing `name` property in the `sapHttp.yaml`. Refer to [SAP Content Repository Connection](/configuration/aqilink/#sap-http-content-server-connection). |  `sapHttp/sharepoint-al` |
   | **Transfer drctry** | Some ArchiveLink scenarios require files to be created in a transfer directory (on the SAP side) before being sent to the content server. Edit this if the default value does not align with your corporate standards. | `/tmp/`|
   | **HTTPS on frontend** | Select `HTTPS required` to ensure a secure HTTPS connection at all times. | |
   | **HTTPS on backend** | Select `HTTPS required` to ensure a secure HTTPS connection at all times. | |

   This is what it looks like in the SAP GUI:
   ![SAP Customizing: OAC0](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0001_oac0_create.png)

4) Save the newly created repository (`CTRL`+`S`).
5) Test the connection using either the *Test Connection* or *Status information* icon (refer to the `Orange` highlighted buttons in the image above). Now, you should receive a message, that the content repository does not exists.

   ![SAP Customizing: OAC0 Test Connection](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0002_oac0_create_test_connection.png)

   !> If you receive any other message than the above one, make sure the connection to the **`aqilink`** server is working. In case of a message similar like *`Payment required`* make sure to have entered the (valid) [license key](/installation/app-configuration?id=enter-license-key). 
   
   !> In case of any *Handshake* or *SSL* related exception, check your HTTPS settings. Refer to [Communication via HTTPS](/reference/aqilink_sap_https) 

6) The basic HTTP connection is working now.

## Create Content Repository in SharePoint
The repository must be created in SharePoint Online as well. 

1) Click on icon *--> CS Admin* (*C*ontent *S*erver *Admin*istration) in the middle of the screen, besides the *Test connection* icon. Refer to image in step 3) of the previous section.
2) Create the repository in SharePoint using the *Create repository* icon in the *Create* section (highlighted in `Orange` below). All settings in this screen can be left with their defaults.

   ![SAP Customizing: OAC0 CS Admin Create Repo](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0003_oac0_cs_admin_repo.png)

3) You should be redirected to the *Details* section where some basic information from the `aqilink` server shows up.
   
   ![SAP Customizing: OAC0 CS Admin Repo created](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0004_oac0_cs_admin_repo_created.png)

4) Stay in this screen and continue with the next section.

## Secure Connection using Certificate
Secure the connection between SAP and SharePoint by using a certificate that will be stored in SharePoint, allowing only authorized requests from the SAP Content Repository.

!> We strongly recommend securing the connection between SAP and SharePoint at all times.

1) Click on section *Certificates*.
2) Send the certificate by clicking on the envelope icon.
   
   ![SAP Customizing: OAC0 CS Admin Certificate](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0005_oac0_cs_admin_certificate.png)

3) After sending the certificate, it will appear in the *Certificate Properties* table. Note the state of the checkbox â€“ it is not checked, it means the certificate is not yet active

   ![SAP Customizing: OAC0 CS Admin Certificate Sent](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0005_oac0_cs_admin_certificate_available.png)

4) Enable security by activating the certificate in SharePoint.

   !> According to the SAP HTTP-Content Server protocol specification, the certificate can only be activated from the content repository side, serving as an additional security measure. Therefore, no further action is required in SAP. To proceed with the activation, log in to the related SharePoint site.

   4.1 Login to the related site in SharePoint as site owner (or with *full control* permission).

   4.2 Navigate to the customized **`aqilink`** administration folder which holds all the repository files and certificates from the SAP system. Refer to value of setting `adminPath` in the related [Storage Connections](/configuration/aqilink/#microsoft-sharepoint-online-spo) chapter.

   !> Under this `adminPath`, you will find a folder named with the value you entered as [SAP HTTP-Content Server Connection](/configuration/aqilink/#sap-http-content-server-connection) for the`HTTP Script` during the repository creation mentioned above. The folder's name is also concatenated with the name of the content repository itself.
   
   ![SharePoint Administration: Activate Certificate](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0007_spo_adminpath.png)

   4.3 The certificate has the extension **`.pem`**. To activate it, edit the properties and tick the checkbox for *SAP Certificate Activated*, then click on *Save*. 
   
   ![SharePoint Administration: Certificate activated](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0008_spo_certificate_activated.png)

   4.4 Crosscheck whether the connection is now secure. Do it in SAP. 

5) Go back to SAP and navigate to the recently created SAP Content Repository again. Open the *--> CS Admin* again and click on the *Certificates* section.
   If the SAP GUI with the screen is still open in the background, just click the *Refresh* icon. 

6) Now, the checkbox in front of the certificate in the *Certificate Properties* table is enabled.

   ![SAP Customizing: Certificate active](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0009_oac0_certificate_active.png)

7) With that, the SAP Content Repository is successfully connected to SharePoint.

# Functional Test
This section describes how `aqilink`, and therefore the ArchiveLink interface, can be tested. The testing requires some additional SAP fundamentals. Also, it's based on the same procedure used by SAP to certify the `aqilink` ArchiveLink interface.

> In order to successfully complete these tests, all the steps above should have been completed.

1) Login to SAP and open the *ABAP Editor* using transaction `SE38`.
2) Enter `RSCMST` in the Program field and execute it by either click *Execute* in the toolbar or press `F8` to execute it.
   
   ![SAP Functional Test: RSCMST](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0010_se38_rscmst.png)

3) In this screen enter the recently created SAP Content Repository, connected to SharePoint, in the Repository field. Again, click *Execute* in the toolbar or press `F8`.
   
   ![SAP Functional Test: RSCMST for Repo](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0011_se38_execute_repository.png)

4) Now, all related sub-reports are listed that could be executed against the repository.
   
5) The most important report is `RSCMSTH0`, which will test the basic communication like `create`, `info`, `search`, `update` or even `delete` commands via HTTP against the repository. Use the *Execute* icon for the report.

   ![SAP Functional Test: RSCMST Sub-reports](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0012_se38_execute_rscmsth0.png)

6) **Optional:** To test additional functionality of the HTTP interface use the available test reports `RSCMSTH1`, `RSCMSTH2` and `RSCMSTH3`.

   ![SAP Functional Test: RSCMST Sub-reports 123](../../../_media/sap_customizing/sharepoint/0013_se38_execute_rscmsth123.png)

   !> There is a known issue in the `RSCMSTH2` report in SAP BASIS components 740 to 752. If this report returns with a lot of errors regarding document protection like `DOC_P[rc]`, refer to the following SAP OSS notes: 2371386, 2198970. Skip this report unless the notes are implemented.

Congratulations! You have successfully connected SAP to Microsoft SharePoint Online and have also verified that the technical connection is working correctly. You are now ready to proceed and customize your use-cases in SAP to store documents in the new repository (SharePoint).
